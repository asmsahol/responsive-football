                    <a href="">14 July 2021</a>
                    <p>In a huge development that will bring great relief to the fans, Barcelona and Lionel Messi have reached an agreement in principle over a new five-year contract, reports SPORT. An announcement is expected at the end of the week, it further adds.

                        Messi’s contract situation has been dominating the headlines for a long while now. The 34-year-old saw his deal with Barca run out at the end of last month, meaning he has been a free agent for two weeks now.</p>
